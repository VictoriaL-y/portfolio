            <header>Loops and iteration</header>
            <p>Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide
                introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.</p>

            <p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps
                in
                one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be
                expressed this way as a loop:</p>

<code>for (let step = 0; step &#60; 5; step++) {
    // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
    console.log('Walking east one step');
}
</code>

            <p>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an
                action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)</p>

            <p>The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop.
                There
                are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.</p>

            <section id="for_statement" class="main-section">
                <header>for statement</header>
                <p>A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar
                    to the Java and C for loop.</p>
                <p>A for statement looks as follows:</p>
<code>for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
    statement
</code>
                <p>When a for loop executes, the following occurs:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually
                            initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of
                            complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true,
                            the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates. (If the conditionExpression
                            expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group
                            those statements.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Control returns to Step 2.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>In the example below, the function contains a for statement that counts the number of selected
                    options in a scrolling list (a &#60;select&#62; element that allows multiple selections).</p>
                <h2>HTML</h2>
<code>&#60;form name="selectForm">
    &#60;label for="musicTypes"&#62;Choose some music types, 
    then click the button below:&#60;/label&#62;
    &#60;select id="musicTypes" name="musicTypes" multiple&#62;
        &#60;option selected&#62;R&B&#60;/option&#62;
        &#60;option&#62;Jazz&#60;/option&#62;
        &#60;option&#62;Blues&#60;/option&#62;
        &#60;option&#62;New Age&#60;/option&#62;
        &#60;option&#62;Classical&#60;/option&#62;
        &#60;option&#62;Opera&#60;/option&#62;
    &#60;/select&#62;
    &#60;button id="btn" type="button">How many are selected?&#60;/button&#62;
&#60;/form&#62;
</code>
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Here, the for statement declares the variable i and initializes it to 0. It checks that i is less
                    than the number of options in the &#60;select&#62; element, performs the succeeding if statement,
                    and increments i by 1 after each pass through the loop.</p>
<code>function howMany(selectObject) {
    let numberSelected = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i &#60; selectObject.options.length; i++) {
        if (selectObject.options[i].selected) {
            numberSelected++;
        }
    }
    return numberSelected;
}
    
const btn = document.getElementById('btn');
    
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const musicTypes = document.selectForm.musicTypes;
    console.log(`You have selected ${howMany(musicTypes)} option(s).`);
});
</code>

            <section id="do...while_statement" class="main-section">
                <header>do...while statement</header>
                <p>The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.</p>
                <p>A do...while statement looks as follows:</p>
<code>do
    statement
while (condition);
</code>

                <p>statement is always executed once before the condition is checked. (To execute multiple
                    statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.)</p>
                <p>If condition is true, the statement executes again. At the end of every execution, the condition
                    is checked. When the condition is false, execution stops, and control passes to the statement
                    following do...while.</p>

                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>In the following example, the do loop iterates at least once and reiterates until i is no longer
                    less than 5.</p>
<code>let i = 0;
do {
    i += 1;
    console.log(i);
} while (i &#60; 5);
</code>
            </section>

            <section id="while_statement" class="main-section">
                <header>while statement</header>
                <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
                    statement looks as follows:</p>
<code>while (condition)
    statement
</code>
                <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                    statement following the loop.</p>
                <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                    statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                    stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
                <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.</p>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than 3:</p>
<code>let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n &#60; 3) {
    n++;
    x += n;
}
</code>
                <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the
                    following values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n &#60; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.
                </p>

            <section id="labeled_statement" class="main-section">
                <header>labeled statement</header>
                <p>A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program.
                    For example, you can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements
                    to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.</p>
                <p>The syntax of the labeled statement looks like the following:</p>
<code>label:
    statement
</code>
                <p>The value of label may be any JavaScript identifier that is not a reserved word. The statement that
                    you identify with a label may be any statement.</p>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>In this example, the label markLoop identifies a while loop.</p>
<code>markLoop:
while (theMark) {
    doSomething();
}
</code>
            </section>

            <section id="break_statement" class="main-section">
                <header>break statement</header>
                <p>Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost enclosing while, do-while, for,
                        or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement.</li>
                    <li>When you use break with a label, it terminates the specified labeled statement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The syntax of the break statement looks like this:</p>
<code>break;
break label;
</code>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first form of the syntax terminates the innermost enclosing loop or switch.</li>
                    <li>The second form of the syntax terminates the specified enclosing labeled statement.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>The following example iterates through the elements in an array until it finds the index of an
                    element whose value is theValue:</p>
<code>for (let i = 0; i &#60; a.length; i++) {
    if (a[i] === theValue) {
        break;
    }
}
</code>
            </section>

            <section id="continue_statement" class="main-section">
                <header>continue statement</header>
                <p>The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you use continue without a label, it terminates the current iteration of the innermost
                        enclosing while, do-while, or for statement and continues execution of the loop with the next
                        iteration. In contrast to the break statement, continue does not terminate the execution of the
                        loop entirely. In a while loop, it jumps back to the condition. In a for loop, it jumps to the
                        increment-expression.</li>
                    <li>When you use continue with a label, it applies to the looping statement identified with that
                        label.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The syntax of the continue statement looks like the following:</p>
<code>continue;
continue label;
</code>

                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>The following example shows a while loop with a continue statement that executes when the value of i
                    is 3. Thus, n takes on the values 1, 3, 7, and 12.</p>
<code>let i = 0;
let n = 0;
while (i &#60; 5) {
    i++;
    if (i === 3) {
        continue;
    }
    n += i;
    console.log(n);
}
//1,3,7,12
</code>

                <p>If you comment out the continue;, the loop would run till the end and you would see 1,3,6,10,15.</p>

                <header>for...in statement</header>
                <p>The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object.
                    For each distinct property, JavaScript executes the specified statements. A for...in statement looks
                    as follows:</p>
<code>for (variable in object)
    statement
</code>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>The following function takes as its argument an object and the object's name. It then iterates over
                    all the object's properties and returns a string that lists the property names and their values.</p>
<code>function dumpProps(obj, objName) {
    let result = '';

        result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}&#60;br&#62;`;
    }
    result += '&#60;hr&#62;';
    return result;
}
</code>

                <p>For an object car with properties make and model, result would be:</p>
<code>car.make = Ford
car.model = Mustang

                <header>for...of statement</header>
                <p>The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects (including Array, Map, Set,
                    arguments object and so on), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the
                    value of each distinct property.</p>
<code>for (variable of object)
    statement
</code>
                <p>The following example shows the difference between a for...of loop and a for...in loop. While
                    for...in iterates over property names, for...of iterates over property values:</p>
<code>const arr = [3, 5, 7];
arr.foo = 'hello';

for (const i in arr) {
    console.log(i); // logs "0", "1", "2", "foo"
}

for (const i of arr) {
