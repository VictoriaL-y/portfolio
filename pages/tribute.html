                        <div class="indent">The earliest evidence of settlements in the area of
                            today's Berlin are remnants of a house foundation dated to 1174, found in excavations in
                            Berlin
                            Mitte, and a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192. The first written records of towns
                            in
                            the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned
                            in
                            1197 and Köpenick in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920. The central
                            part
                            of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. Cölln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a
                            1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is
                            referenced in a document from 1244. 1237 is considered the founding date of the city. The
                            two
                            towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on
                            the
                            two important trade routes Via Imperii and from Bruges to Novgorod. In 1307, they formed an
                            alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being
                            separated.

                        <div class="indent">In 1415, Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg,
                            which he ruled until 1440. During the 15th century, his successors established Berlin-Cölln
                            as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the Hohenzollern family ruled in
                            Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and
                            eventually as German emperors. In 1443, Frederick II Irontooth started the construction of a
                            new royal palace in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against
                            the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" ("Berliner Unwille"). This
                            protest was not successful and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic
                            privileges. After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. From
                            1470, with the new elector Albrecht III Achilles, Berlin-Cölln became the new royal
                            residence. Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg
                            electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when John Cicero came to power. Berlin-Cölln,
                            however, had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic city. In 1539, the electors and the
                            city officially became Lutheran.

                        <div class="indent">The Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648 devastated
                            Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its
                            population. Frederick William, known as the "Great Elector", who had succeeded his father
                            George
                            William as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious
                            tolerance.
                            With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French Huguenots.

                        <div class="indent">By 1700, approximately 30 percent of Berlin's residents were French, because
                            of the Huguenot immigration. Many other immigrants came from Bohemia, Poland, and Salzburg.

                        <div class="indent">Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in personal union with
                            the Duchy of Prussia. In 1701, the dual state formed the Kingdom of Prussia, as Frederick
                            III, Elector of Brandenburg, crowned himself as king Frederick I in Prussia. Berlin became
                            the capital of the new Kingdom, replacing Königsberg. This was a successful attempt to
                            centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began
                            to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder,
                            Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, "Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".

                        <div class="indent">In 1740, Frederick II, known as Frederick the Great (1740–1786), came to
                            power. Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of the Enlightenment, but
                            also, was briefly occupied during the Seven Years' War by the Russian army. Following
                            France's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte marched into Berlin
                            in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. In 1815, the city became part of the new
                            Province of Brandenburg.

                            city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and
                            economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and
                            population of Berlin. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including Wedding, Moabit and several
                            others were incorporated into Berlin. In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded
                            German Empire. In 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.

                        <div class="indent">In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile
                            ground for the German Expressionist movement. In fields such as architecture, painting and
                            cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the First World War in
                            1918, a
                            republic was proclaimed by Philipp Scheidemann at the Reichstag building. In 1920, the
                            Greater
                            Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into
                            an
                            expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66 to 883 km2 (25 to 341 sq mi).
                            The
                            population almost doubled, and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the
                            Weimar
                            era, Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties but also became a
                            renowned
                            center of the Roaring Twenties. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world
                            capital
                            and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city
                            planning, film, higher education, government, and industries. Albert Einstein rose to public
                            prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.

                        <div class="indent">In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. NSDAP rule
                            diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to
                            about 80,000 due to emigration between 1933 and 1939. After Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands
                            of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Starting
                            in early 1943, many were shipped to concentration camps, such as Auschwitz. Berlin is the
                            most heavily bombed city in history.[citation needed] During World War II, large parts of
                            Berlin were destroyed during 1943–45 Allied air raids and the 1945 Battle of Berlin. The
                            Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built-up
                            area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed. After the end of the war in Europe in May 1945,
                            Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers
                            divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the occupation zones into which Germany was
                            divided. The sectors of the Western Allies (the United States, the United Kingdom, and
                            France) formed West Berlin, while the Soviet sector formed East Berlin.

                        <div class="indent">All four Allies shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However,
                            in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of
                            Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the Soviet Union imposed a blockade on the
                            access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled
                            territory. The Berlin airlift, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade
                            by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949. In 1949, the
                            Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany and eventually included all of the
                            American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while
                            the Marxist-Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin
                            officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal
                            Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West
                            Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

                        <div class="indent">The founding of the two German states increased Cold War tensions. West
                            Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part
                            as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of
                            the city's historic center. The West German government established itself in Bonn.[56] In
                            1961, East Germany began to build the Berlin Wall around West Berlin, and events escalated
                            to a tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West
                            Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.
                            John F. Kennedy gave his "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech on June 26, 1963, in front of the
                            Schöneberg city hall, located in the city's western part, underlining the US support for
                            West Berlin.[57] Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to
                            pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners, travel
                            to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a
                            Four-Power agreement guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East
                            Germany.

                        <div class="indent">In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German
                            population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished.
                            Today, the East Side Gallery preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the
                            two parts of Germany were reunified as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again
                            became a reunified city.[59] Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor
                            of the reunified city in the interim. City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the
                            first "all Berlin" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate
                            offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a
                            former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.[60] On 18
                            June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was
                            part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a
                            reunified Berlin (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure
                            of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the Bundestag (German
                            Parliament) voted to move the seat of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was
                            completed in 1999.

                            COVID-19 pandemic, plans were announced to temporarily close BER's Terminal 5, the former
                            Schönefeld Airport, beginning in March 2021 for up to one year. The connecting link of
                            U-Bahn line U5 from Alexanderplatz to Hauptbahnhof, along with the new stations Rotes
                            Rathaus and Unter den Linden, opened on 4 December 2020, with the Museumsinsel U-Bahn
                            station expected to open around March 2021, which would complete all new works on the U5. A
                            partial opening by the end of 2020 of the Humboldt Forum museum, housed in the reconstructed
                            Berlin Palace, which had been announced in June, was postponed until March 2021.
